# Williamsburg Bridge Digital Twin CAD/Mesh Build Handoff

Purpose: create a self-contained instruction package for a VS Code agentic build harness to produce the most accurate browser-renderable CAD/mesh digital twin of the Williamsburg Bridge possible, with enough part-level structure to support HO-scale study and future 3D-print preparation.

This handoff prioritizes geometry accuracy, source traceability, component addressability, and browser-renderable visual fidelity. It does not prioritize slicer settings, infill, supports, or other print-production details.

---

## 1. Core Build Objective

Build a browser-renderable, part-addressable Williamsburg Bridge digital twin that supports:

- Whole-bridge visual rendering in a browser.
- Drill-down by component and subsystem.
- Source-linked geometry confidence levels.
- HO-scale dimensional reference.
- Export to `.glb/.gltf`, plus archival CAD/mesh working files.
- Future conversion into printable components if needed.

Primary rule: do not treat any existing 3D model as authoritative. Use official dimensions, archival drawings, HAER/LOC records, engineering references, and known bridge measurements as control geometry. Use photogrammetry, video, images, and marketplace/community meshes only as secondary visual/detail references.

---

## 2. Control dimensions — read from sources, one row at a time

**This table was empty on purpose.** It stayed empty until sources had actually been read.

The Manhattan Bridge brief this file was adapted from carried a filled-in table here under the
heading "use these as initial control values". Those are *Manhattan Bridge* figures. They are not
approximations of Williamsburg Bridge figures, they are a different structure's measurements, and
seeding them here would have been the exact failure this programme is built to prevent.

> **Negative control.** The Manhattan Bridge's dimensions are registered in
> `manhattan-bridge-3d/SOURCE-REGISTER.md` and **must never enter this model**. Three similar East
> River suspension bridges are the most likely route to a confident wrong number. The other two
> bridges' figures are registered in `SOURCE-REGISTER.md` §5 as NEG-001 and NEG-002, sources that
> may not be used, so cross-contamination is a test failure rather than a silent error.

The rows below were each entered from a source that was opened and read. **The authoritative and
complete set is `GEOMETRY-CONTROL.md`** — 43 controls, of which 37 are sourced and 6 are
placeholders. This table reproduces only the controls that establish the overall envelope.

| Control ID | Key | Value | Unit | Source IDs | Confidence | Notes |
|---|---|---:|---|---|---|---|
| CTL-001 | main_span_tower_to_tower | 1600 | ft | SRC-001, SRC-003, SRC-004 | A | Three sources agree. The strongest number this bridge has. |
| CTL-002 | total_length_including_approaches | 7308 | ft | SRC-003, SRC-004 | A | Conflicts with SRC-001's 7,200 ft; see CNF-001. |
| CTL-003 | navigation_clearance_at_center | 135 | ft | SRC-001, SRC-003, SRC-004 | A | Clearance beneath the span, above mean high water. Not a height of the structure. |
| CTL-004 | main_cable_count | 4 | count | SRC-001, SRC-003, SRC-004 | A | Two pairs, north and south. |
| CTL-005 | main_cable_diameter | 18 | in | SRC-001, SRC-003 | A | Nominal; SRC-004 gives 18 to 18.75 in. See CNF-004. |
| CTL-006 | tower_height | 310 | ft | SRC-003 | A | Datum not stated by the source. SRC-004 says 333 or 335 ft above MHW. See CNF-002, OQ-004. |
| CTL-007 | transit_track_count | 2 | count | SRC-003, SRC-004 | A | **Two, not four.** See the correction to section 6 below, CNF-003 and NEG-003. |
| CTL-008 | deck_width | 118 | ft | SRC-004 | C | Also the length of the transverse floor beams. |
| CTL-009 | stiffening_truss_spacing | 67 | ft | SRC-004 | C | |
| CTL-010 | stiffening_truss_depth | 40 | ft | SRC-004 | C | Three times the depth of the Brooklyn Bridge's. |
| CTL-101 | side_span_tower_to_anchorage | 600 | ft | | D | **Placeholder, OQ-001.** No source read states the side-span length. Deliberately round so it cannot be mistaken for a measurement. Do not quote it. |

Rules the parser enforces, not the reviewer:

- Only grade `D` may cite no source. Anything `A`/`B`/`C` without a source is a parse error.
- Grade `D` may not cite sources. A placeholder must not appear to rest on evidence.
- Values are bare decimals. No thousands separators, no ranges, no "approx".

A complete HO model of a bridge this size is very large — over 25 metres end to end, see
`SCALE-HO.md`. Treat the full bridge as a digital twin first, and extract modular study pieces later.

## 3. Source Hierarchy

### Tier A: Control Geometry

Use these to establish the canonical bridge coordinate system and dimensions.

1. NYC DOT Williamsburg Bridge official facts.
2. ASCE Williamsburg Bridge engineering facts.
3. HAER / Library of Congress Williamsburg Bridge record.
4. 1907 to 1909 contract drawings.

6. Known bridge measurements from prior research, including main span, side spans, suspended length, total bridge and approach length, tower height, cable diameter, and deck organization.

### Tier B: Detail Geometry

Use for secondary validation and missing part-level detail.

1. HistoricBridges.org full-size detail photo galleries.
2. Wikimedia Commons Williamsburg Bridge categories and subcategories.
3. Wikimedia Commons construction, close-up, anchorage, footpath, rail track, and arch/colonnade images.
4. HAER / LOC public-domain photographs.
5. 360-degree pedestrian path videos.

## 5. Phase 1: Establish Control Skeleton

Agent goal: create a mathematically constrained bridge skeleton before touching visual meshes.

Tasks:

1. Define world units in meters.
2. Add optional HO-scale export using 1:87.1 scale.
3. Set bridge origin at midpoint of main span.
4. Define X axis along bridge length.
5. Define Y axis across bridge width.
6. Define Z axis vertical.
7. Create reference stations:
   - Manhattan anchorage.
   - Manhattan tower.
   - Main-span midpoint.
   - Brooklyn tower.
   - Brooklyn anchorage.
   - Approach endpoints.
8. Encode known dimensions in `GEOMETRY-CONTROL.md`.
9. Build initial control curves:
   - deck centerline.
   - main cable parabolic/catenary approximation.
   - tower centerlines.
   - suspender spacing placeholders.
   - stiffening truss envelope.
   - roadway deck envelope.
   - subway track envelope.

Expected outputs:

```text
/cad/procedural/control_skeleton.blend
/cad/procedural/control_skeleton.step
/mesh/glb/control_skeleton.glb
```

---

## 6. Phase 2: Component Taxonomy

Agent goal: every visible part should belong to a named system.

> **Correction, entered from sources.** The minimum hierarchy below lists four subway tracks. That
> is inherited from the Manhattan Bridge, which this brief was adapted from. The Williamsburg Bridge
> carries **two** rapid transit tracks (J, M, Z), flanked by inner roadways that were originally
> streetcar tracks — SRC-003 and SRC-004, recorded as CTL-007. The four-track taxonomy is registered
> as negative control NEG-003 and the disagreement as CNF-003. The model carries two tracks, and
> test GRT-007 fails the build if a `track_3` or `track_4` ever appears. `track_3` and `track_4`
> below are struck through for that reason.

Minimum hierarchy:

```json
{
  "bridge": {
    "anchorages": ["manhattan_anchorage", "brooklyn_anchorage"],
    "towers": ["manhattan_tower", "brooklyn_tower"],
    "cables": [
      "north_main_cable_1",
      "north_main_cable_2",
      "south_main_cable_1",
      "south_main_cable_2"
    ],
    "suspenders": [],
    "deck_system": {
      "upper_roadway": [],
      "lower_roadway": [],
      "subway_tracks": ["track_1", "track_2"],
      "stiffening_trusses": [],
      "cross_girders": [],
      "floor_beams": []
    },
    "approaches": ["manhattan_approach", "brooklyn_approach"],
    "details": [
      "railings",
      "stairs",
      "catenary",
      "lamp_posts",
      "signage",
      "maintenance_platforms"
    ]
  }
}
```

Each part should carry metadata:

```json
{
  "part_id": "tower_manhattan_arch_panel_001",
  "system": "tower",
  "source_basis": ["drawing", "photo", "mesh_reference", "inferred"],
  "confidence": "A|B|C|D",
  "prototype_units": "meters",
  "ho_scale_units": "millimeters",
  "notes": ""
}
```

---

## 7. Phase 3: Photogrammetry Pipeline

Agent goal: create photogrammetric point clouds and meshes for visual detail and relative placement, not as sole dimensional truth.

### Route A: COLMAP

Use COLMAP for Structure-from-Motion and Multi-View Stereo reconstruction from ordered or unordered image collections.

Expected workspace:

```text
/photogrammetry/colmap/
  /workspace/
    /images/
    /sparse/
    /dense/
      fused.ply
      meshed-poisson.ply
      meshed-delaunay.ply
```

Recommended agent tasks:

1. Ingest images into named photo sets.
2. Preserve source URLs, licenses, and metadata.
3. Run sparse reconstruction.
4. Run dense reconstruction.
5. Export point cloud and mesh.
6. Align output to control skeleton.
7. Use photogrammetry mesh for local visual detail only.

### Route B: Meshroom / AliceVision

Use Meshroom for alternate open-source reconstruction and textured visual outputs.

Expected stages:

1. Camera initialization.
2. Feature extraction.
3. Image matching.
4. Feature matching.
5. Structure from motion.
6. Dense scene preparation.
7. Depth map generation.
8. Depth map filtering.
9. Meshing.
10. Mesh filtering.
11. Texturing.

Use Meshroom when texturing and visual reconstruction are more important than dimensional authority.

---

## 8. Photogrammetry Capture and Source Plan

Create image sets by zone:

```text
image-set-001-main-towers
image-set-002-main-cables
image-set-003-suspenders
image-set-004-deck-trusses
image-set-005-subway-track-bays
image-set-006-pedestrian-path
image-set-007-anchorages
image-set-008-approach-spans
image-set-009-ornamental-details
```

For each image set, create a manifest:

```json
{
  "image_set_id": "image-set-004-deck-trusses",
  "source": "Wikimedia / field photo / video frame / HistoricBridges",
  "license": "",
  "camera_metadata_available": true,
  "coverage": "north side lower deck truss",
  "use": "visual reference | photogrammetry | texture | measurement aid",
  "quality": "high | medium | low"
}
```

Important: extracted 360-degree video frames can help with continuity and detail orientation, but they should not override measured geometry unless scale control points exist.

---

## 9. Mesh Alignment Workflow

For every imported mesh:

1. Import raw model into `/mesh/raw`.
2. Preserve original file and license.
3. Convert to neutral working format such as `.obj`, `.fbx`, `.blend`, or `.ply`.
4. Align to the control skeleton using:
   - tower centerlines.
   - deck elevation.
   - main-span endpoints.
   - anchorage positions.
5. Scale against known total/main-span dimensions.
6. Mark deviations in `mesh_alignment_report.md`.
7. Split into named components.
8. Delete or isolate non-bridge scenery.
9. Replace texture-only details with actual geometry where needed.
10. Export review version as `.glb`.

---

## 10. Browser Render Target

Primary delivery format: `.glb` and `.gltf`.

Viewer requirements:

```text
- Load full bridge GLB.
- Toggle systems on/off.
- Click part to show metadata.
- Show source/confidence overlay.
- Toggle HO-scale dimensions.
- Toggle archival drawing overlay.
- Toggle photogrammetry point cloud.
- Support LOD switching.
- Support exploded part schematic view.
```

Recommended browser stack:

```text
- Three.js or React Three Fiber.
- GLTFLoader for GLB/glTF assets.
- Sidebar metadata panel.
- Component tree explorer.
- Source/confidence legend.
- Measurement overlay.
```

---

## 11. Accuracy and Confidence Model

Use explicit confidence tags:

```text
A = derived from official dimension or archival drawing.
B = derived from multiple consistent photos plus known control geometry.
C = derived from existing mesh or photogrammetry aligned to controls.
D = inferred, decorative, or placeholder.
```

No part should enter the final model without:

```text
part_id
source_basis
confidence
scale
last_modified_by_agent
review_status
```

---

## 12. Agent Instruction Block

```markdown
You are building an accurate digital twin of the Williamsburg Bridge for browser rendering and HO-scale study.

Primary rule:
Do not treat any existing 3D model as authoritative. Use official dimensions, archival drawings, HAER/LOC data, and known bridge measurements as control geometry. Use photogrammetry and marketplace/community meshes only as secondary visual references.

Deliverables:
1. Build a source-linked control skeleton.
2. Create component taxonomy.
3. Ingest and align external meshes.
4. Build or refine geometry by component.
5. Create LOD0, LOD1, and LOD2 versions.
6. Export GLB/glTF for browser rendering.
7. Attach metadata to every named component.
8. Produce dimension validation reports.
9. Produce confidence overlays for source traceability.

Do not optimize for printer infill. Optimize for visual accuracy, component addressability, scale fidelity, source traceability, and browser renderability.
```

---

## 13. First Build Milestone

Build this first:

```text
Milestone 1: Control Skeleton + Browser Viewer
- bridge centerline.
- towers.
- deck envelope.
- main cables.
- side spans.
- anchorages.
- two subway tracks (see the correction in section 6).
- basic truss envelope.
- clickable metadata.
- HO-scale dimension toggle.
```

**Status: complete.** 57 parts, 43 controls, 9 registered sources, 11 open questions, 8 registered
conflicts, 32 tests passing and 4 reporting. See `README.md` for what the sources actually support,
and `GEOMETRY-CONTROL.md` §5 for what they do not.

This milestone creates a stable truth model before importing noisy meshes, photogrammetry products, or existing commercial/community models.

---

## 14. Validation Checklist

Before accepting any geometry:

```text
[ ] Does it align to the control skeleton?
[ ] Is its source recorded?
[ ] Is the confidence level assigned?
[ ] Is it part-addressable?
[ ] Is it named consistently?
[ ] Is it assigned to a system and subsystem?
[ ] Has it been exported to GLB for browser review?
[ ] Has it been checked against at least one Tier A or Tier B source where possible?
[ ] Is the deviation from known dimensions recorded?
```

---

## 15. Notes for Claude / OpenAI VS Code Agentic Harness

Recommended execution pattern:

1. Read `SOURCE-REGISTER.md` and `GEOMETRY-CONTROL.md` first.
2. Build `control_skeleton.blend` procedurally.
3. Export `control_skeleton.glb`.
4. Build a modular minimal browser viewer usable for other similar models
5. Add metadata panel and component picking.
6. Import reference meshes one at a time.
7. Never merge raw meshes directly into the authoritative model.
8. Use alignment reports to compare external meshes against the control skeleton.
9. Promote geometry only when it has traceable source basis.
10. Keep all inferred or decorative geometry tagged as confidence D until reviewed.

```

---

## 18. Final Operating Principle

The digital twin should be model-first and source-governed. The correct sequence is:

```text
sources -> control dimensions -> skeleton -> parts taxonomy -> validated geometry -> visual detail -> browser render -> optional print modules
```

Avoid the opposite pattern:

```text
existing mesh -> cleanup -> assumed bridge model
```

That path will produce a visually plausible asset, but not a trustworthy Williamsburg Bridge digital twin.
